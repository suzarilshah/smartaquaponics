# smartaquaponics
This repository contains the coding for Smart Aquaponics Systems IoT solutions 

This project has recently been updated at: https://github.com/suzarilshah/agriphonics

## * Problem Statement *: 
### Nowadays, in this pandemic, food are becoming more expensive , particularly due to the inflation rate and people started to look for other alternative to get their food from; Growing their own food at their convenient - from home, not to mention, organic and healthy food. Aquaponics started becoming popular as it introduces nurturing plants and fish in one go. But Aquaponics also comes with a problem; you will need to pay extra care for both fish and plant and that require costly implementation and maintenance solutions. This project will eliminate that by providing a cheap, IoT-based and easy solution to solve the aforementioned challenges.

## * Objective *:
### - Increasing Food Production and eliminate food hunger.
### - Reducing the cost to implement Aquaponics

## * Technical Objective *:
### - Developing a Monitoring solutions using Azure IoT technologies like Azure IoT Hub and Stream Job Analytics
### - Developing a Power Visualization tools displaying Aquaponics parameter using Microsoft PowerApps and PowerBI
### - Implementing Data Analytics using PowerBI
